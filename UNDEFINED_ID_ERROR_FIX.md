# üîß **Fixed: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_id')" Error**

## ‚úÖ **Root Cause & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: JWT Token Mismatch**
**Problem**: JWT token was created with `userId` but middleware was looking for `id`
```javascript
// Login creates token with:
jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, ...)

// But middleware was trying:
decoded.id // ‚ùå undefined
```

**Fix**: Updated auth middleware to use correct property
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Now correctly uses:
decoded.userId
```

### **Issue 2: Authentication Middleware Commented Out**
**Problem**: Routes file had authentication middleware disabled
```javascript
//router.use(authenticateToken); // ‚ùå Commented out
```

**Fix**: Re-enabled authentication middleware
```javascript
router.use(authenticateToken); // ‚úÖ Active
```

### **Issue 3: API Endpoint Mismatches**
**Problem**: Frontend and backend were using different endpoint structures

**Before (inconsistent)**:
- Frontend: `/api/rooms/create`
- Backend: `POST /create`
- Routes: Non-RESTful endpoints

**After (RESTful & consistent)**:
- Frontend: `/api/rooms`
- Backend: `POST /`
- All routes follow REST conventions

### **Issue 4: User Object Validation**
**Problem**: No validation if `req.user` exists before accessing `_id`

**Fix**: Added proper validation in controllers
```javascript
if (!req.user || !req.user._id) {
  return res.status(401).json({ message: 'User not authenticated' });
}
```

## **Updated Route Structures**

### **Rooms API** ‚úÖ
```
POST   /api/rooms      - Create room
GET    /api/rooms      - Get user's rooms  
GET    /api/rooms/:id  - Get specific room
PUT    /api/rooms/:id  - Update room
DELETE /api/rooms/:id  - Delete room
```

### **Sessions API** ‚úÖ
```
POST   /api/sessions      - Create session
GET    /api/sessions      - Get sessions
GET    /api/sessions/:id  - Get specific session
PUT    /api/sessions/:id  - Update session
DELETE /api/sessions/:id  - Delete session
```

### **Members API** ‚úÖ
```
POST   /api/members      - Create member
POST   /api/members/bulk - Bulk create members
GET    /api/members      - Get members
GET    /api/members/:id  - Get specific member
PUT    /api/members/:id  - Update member
DELETE /api/members/:id  - Delete member
```

## **Debug Features Added**
- Console logging in room controller to track user object
- Better error messages for authentication failures
- Proper error handling in all CRUD operations

The `_id` undefined error should now be completely resolved! üéâ
